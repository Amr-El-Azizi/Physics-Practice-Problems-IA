 1. Acceleration|An object accelerated at a rate of 24.0ms^-2 and had a total change of velocity of 7.0ms^-1. How long was it accelerating for?|0.2916666666666667|s~

1. Throwing a ball|An object is thrown straight vertically upwards out of a hovering helicopter at a velocity of 5.0ms^-1. How high up is the helicopter if the ball takes 25.0s to reach the ground?|3250.0|s~

1. Launching a Ball off of a surface|A ball is kicked off of a building 19.0m high with a horizontal velocity of 4.0ms^-1. Ignoring fluid resistance, how far does it travel before it hits the ground?|NaN|ms~

1. Horizontal Motion|A cart is moving at a speed of 11.0ms^-1 while being accelerated at a rate of -25.0ms^-2. How long does it take to reach the initial point?|0.88|s~

1. Dropping a ball|A 5.0kg weigh is dropped from the edge of a cliff and has a final velocity of 3.0ms^-1. How long did it take to hit the ground?|0.3|s~
