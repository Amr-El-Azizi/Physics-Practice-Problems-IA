1. Launching an object at an angle|A cannon launches a cannonball at a 80.0 degree angle so that it lands on a surface of the same height. If the initial velocity is 28.0ms^-1, how long does it take to reach the ground?|5.514923415316888|s~

1. Launching a Ball off of a surface|A ball is kicked off of a building 17.0m high with a horizontal velocity of 5.0ms^-1. Ignoring fluid resistance, how far does it travel before it hits the ground?|NaN|ms~

1. Angle of Repose|If the angle of repose between two object a and surface b is 40.0 degrees, what is the coeffecient of friction?|-64.01170042408307|degrees~

1. Dropping a ball|An object weighing 87.0g is dropped from a table and hits the ground after 4.0s. What is the height of the table?|80.0|m~

1. Launching a Ball off of a surface|A brick is thrown horizontally out of a building at the velocity of 2.0ms^-1. If it has a final vertical velocity of 4.0ms^-1, what is its change in displacement?|0.8|m~
