1. Launching a Ball off of a surface|A brick is thrown horizontally out of a building at the velocity of 1.0ms^-1. If it has a final vertical velocity of 2.0ms^-1, what is its change in displacement?|0.2|m~

1. Launching a Ball off of a surface|A ball is kicked off of a building 24.0m high with a horizontal velocity of 2.0ms^-1. Ignoring fluid resistance, how far does it travel before it hits the ground?|NaN|ms~

1. Launching a Ball off of a surface|A ball is kicked off of a building 12.0m high with a horizontal velocity of 5.0ms^-1. Not accounting for friction, what is its final vertical velocity before impact if it weighs 71.0g?|15.491933384829668|ms^-1~

1. Dropping a ball|A 1.0kg weigh is dropped from the edge of a cliff and has a final velocity of 9.0ms^-1. How long did it take to hit the ground?|0.9|s~

1. Acceleration|An object accelerated at a rate of -6.0ms^-2 for 12.0s and reached a velocity of 7.0ms^-1. What was its initial velocity?|79.0|ms^-1~

1. Velocity|If an object moved 7.0m after 22.0s, what was its velocity?|0.3181818181818182|ms^-1~

1. Dropping a ball|A 59.0g penny is dropped from a cliff 9.0m high. What is its final velocity before impact?|13.416407864998739|ms^-1~

1. Throwing a ball|A ball is thrown upwards by someone 2.0m tall with a velocity of 1.0ms^-1. What is its final velocity before impact if it weighs 76.0g?|6.4031242374328485|ms^-1~

1. Dropping a ball|An object is dropped from a helicopter and hits the ground after 57.0s. What is its velocity right before it hits the ocean if it has a density of 88.0gcm^-3?|16245.0|m~

1. Velocity|If an object reached a displacement -3.0m after 19.0s, what was its velocity?|0.15789473684210525|s~
